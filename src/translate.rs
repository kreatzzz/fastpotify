//! Translation and romanization for the lyrics panel, from Google Translate.
//!
//! [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com) needs no account and no
//! key on the endpoint its own web page uses, so the panel can put a line in
//! the reader's language under every lyric line and, when the words are
//! written in a script one cannot sing from, spell the same line in Latin
//! letters.
//!
//! The two aids travel differently. Translation batches well: lines joined
//! with newlines come back with the newlines in place, so a few requests
//! cover a whole song and the answers still line up afterwards. Romanization
//! loses the newlines, so it is asked for one line at a time, a few requests
//! in flight. And when Google hears the song already in the reader's
//! language, there is nothing to add, and nothing more is asked.
//!
//! When Google refuses a whole batch, a keyless public mirror of the same
//! translator is asked behind it, as a last resort. It speaks translation
//! only, so a song it answered has no spelling to offer either.
